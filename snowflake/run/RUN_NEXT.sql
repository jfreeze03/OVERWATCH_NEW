--  OVERWATCH  -  RUN BOX  (RUN_NEXT.sql)          updated: 2026-09-02
-- ===========================================================================
--  APPLY THE OWNER-GATED MIGRATION BACKLOG: V118 -> V123, IN ORDER.
--
--  HOW TO RUN: paste this whole file into a Snowsight worksheet and Run All
--  (or `snow sql -f snowflake/run/RUN_NEXT.sql`). Every migration is guarded
--  (its EXECUTE IMMEDIATE raises -204xx if applied out of order) and idempotent
--  (the SCHEMA_VERSION insert is WHERE NOT EXISTS), so a re-run is safe. V001-
--  V117 are already applied on this account (owner applied through V117 on
--  2026-09-01), so MAX(VERSION) should read 117 before you start.
--
--  What each migration does (full rationale in the file header of each below):
--    V118  SP_LEDGER_AUTOBOOK dedup + one-time corrective pass. A warehouse
--          credit delta is booked ONCE even when several cost levers change in
--          the same window: the primary lever carries the full VERIFIED_USD,
--          co-occurring levers settle VERIFIED at $0. Also corrects rows that
--          V038 had already double-booked. (Round-4/6 finding LBA-1 + MPROC-1.)
--    V119  SP_ALERT_SCAN auto-clear hysteresis. An alert held open by hysteresis
--          (value below RAISE but above CLEAR) is no longer falsely auto-cleared
--          when the clock crosses midnight -- identity is now the date-stripped
--          RULE_ID|scope, not a raise-day-dated DEDUPE_KEY. (Round-6 MPROC-2.)
--    V120  SP_LOAD_PATTERN_COST RUNS fan-out. Pre-aggregates
--          QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY to one row per QUERY_ID before joining
--          QUERY_HISTORY, so an hour-spanning query no longer inflates RUNS /
--          halves CREDITS_PER_RUN. The migration tail re-runs the loader over
--          90d to re-stamp already-inflated rows. (Round-7 loader-01.)
--    V121  Seed COCO_DAILY_CAP_CREDITS (= 15.0) into APP_SETTINGS so the AI-
--          chargeback token-economics cap is configurable from Admin instead of
--          pinned to a code fallback. Idempotent MERGE / WHEN NOT MATCHED, so it
--          never overwrites a value you have already set. (Round-8 SC-1.)
--    V122  SP_ANOMALY_SWEEP scores the LAST 3 COMPLETE DAYS instead of only
--          MAX(DAY), so a cost spike on a day whose fact was mid-reload (the
--          nightly reconcile delete+reload race) self-heals on the next run via
--          the existing per-(series,day) dedup instead of being permanently
--          missed. The migration tail re-runs the sweep. (Round-9 reconcile race.)
--    V123  SP_REFRESH_EXEC_BOARD on the ACCOUNT clock. The exec board's Current-
--          month/Current-year presets keyed WINDOW_DAYS off session/UTC
--          CURRENT_DATE() while every other calendar-month surface uses the
--          account clock (America/Chicago); each evening past Chicago midnight the
--          board's "current month" drifted a day from the MTD pace KPI. Re-derived
--          from V073 with every CURRENT_DATE() -> account-tz date; tail re-runs the
--          refresh. (Round-14 EXEC-TZ.)
--
--  AFTER RUN ALL:
--    * The last block prints SCHEMA_VERSION -- confirm it reads 123.
--    * V120 (loader), V122 (sweep) and V123 (exec board) re-run themselves in-file
--      above. The post-apply block below also re-runs SP_ALERT_SCAN() once so
--      V119's corrected auto-clear re-stamps open alerts immediately (it would
--      otherwise self-heal on the next scheduled scan).
--    * Paste the two RESULT blocks back.
--
--  These five files are byte-identical to snowflake/migrations/V118..V122 on
--  main -- this file only concatenates them in order with a verification tail.
-- ===========================================================================


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- PRE-FLIGHT (informational): confirm the account is at 117 before applying.
-- LOOK FOR: SCHEMA_VERSION = 117. If it already reads 122, the batch is applied.
-- RESULT:
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- ===========================================================================
-- APPLY V118__ledger_autobook_dedup.sql
-- ===========================================================================
-- V118: SP_LEDGER_AUTOBOOK stops double-counting a warehouse's saving when more
-- than one cost lever changes on it in the same measured window (LBA-1, round-4
-- hunt). Root cause: BASELINE_CREDITS_PER_DAY / AFTER_CREDITS_PER_DAY in
-- WAREHOUSE_CHANGE_REGISTRY are WAREHOUSE-level measures, but the registry holds
-- one row per (warehouse, SETTING) change. When (say) AUTO_SUSPEND *and* SIZE both
-- drop on one warehouse in the same window, BOTH rows carry the same warehouse
-- credit delta, so V038's settle booked the full measured saving on EACH row —
-- the ledger total counted one physical saving N times.
--
-- Fix: the measured warehouse delta is attributed to exactly ONE primary change per
-- (warehouse, measured-window signature); co-occurring levers still settle VERIFIED
-- (the change was made and the warehouse did improve) but with VERIFIED_USD = 0 and
-- a co-attribution note, so SUM(VERIFIED_USD) books the warehouse saving once.
-- The measured-window signature is (WAREHOUSE_NAME, BASELINE_CREDITS_PER_DAY,
-- AFTER_CREDITS_PER_DAY, AFTER_DAYS): rows sharing it are, by construction, the same
-- physical measurement (identical SAVED_MONTHLY_USD). Rows that measured genuinely
-- different windows differ in the signature and each keep their own dollars.
--
-- Forward-only settle preserved (only STATE='ESTIMATED' rows move). A one-time,
-- idempotent corrective pass (Step 2) also de-duplicates already-settled VERIFIED
-- rows that V038 double-booked, so the ledger total is correct the moment V118
-- applies. Apply AFTER V117. Idempotent; safe to re-run.

-- auto-clear sweep (re-derived across V091/V096/V115/V117) resolves an OPEN perf

-- event held open by hysteresis (value below RAISE but above the CLEAR floor, so no

-- key and was FALSELY auto-cleared while the condition was still elevated. V096 had
-- widened the resolve window to -48h..-1h but did not mirror that into the

-- (RULE_ID|scope) on both sides, so an event raised yesterday stays open as long as
-- its scope is still >= CLEAR today. Applies to PERF_QUERY_FAIL_PCT /
-- PERF_QUEUED_MINUTES / PERF_SPILL_GB. Proc-only re-derivation of V117 (no schema

-- V122: anomaly sweep self-heals across the reconcile delete+reload race (round-9

-- FACT_METERING_DAILY / FACT_WAREHOUSE_DAILY, which TASK_NIGHTLY_RECONCILE (after the
-- 06:45 daily loader) DELETEs and reloads for D-1..D-3 non-atomically. If the sweep fires
-- while reconcile's re-cover is mid-flight, MAX(DAY) is D-4 and yesterday's genuine credit
-- spike is scored against a truncated series or skipped -- and, since the sweep only scored
-- the single latest day and dedupes per day, it was never re-examined (a permanently missed
-- alert, the exact class V114 aimed to prevent, via the reconcile path it did not consider).
--
-- Fix: SP_ANOMALY_SWEEP scores the last 3 COMPLETE days (D-1..D-3) instead of only MAX(DAY).
-- The existing per-(series,day) DEDUPE_KEY makes each day alert at most once, so a day deleted
-- at sweep time is caught on the next run once reconcile has reloaded it -- self-healing with
-- no task-graph surgery (the definitive alternative, chaining the sweep AFTER
-- TASK_NIGHTLY_RECONCILE per the V071 principle, is left to the owner if reconcile ever

-- Decision Studio quarter, and the Overview MTD pace KPI. During the ~5-6h each evening
-- that UTC has rolled past Chicago midnight (worst on month-end), the board's
-- days-into-month drifted one day from those siblings, so "Spend, current month" and the
-- MTD pace KPI on the same screen could disagree by up to a full month of dollars; and
-- the reader (query-time) vs this loader (refresh-time) could pick different WINDOW_DAYS
-- and blank the board.
--

-- (CONVERT_TIMEZONE('America/Chicago', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())::DATE), so the stored
-- WINDOW_DAYS and the window ranges match the account_today_sql() the reader
-- (app/data/mart_sql.py exec_board) now uses. Output contract, atomic stage swap, source
-- horizons, UNKNOWN scope and the serverless/AI driver arm are otherwise byte-identical.
-- The migration tail re-runs the refresh so the board re-stamps on the account clock
