-- V073__calendar_triage_windows.sql
--
-- The global triage filter now offers Current month and Current year, matching
-- Snowsight Admin > Cost Management calendar presets. MART_EXEC_BOARD previously
-- materialized only seven fixed rolling windows, so a calendar selection had no
-- exact first-paint board row. Re-derived from the latest definition (V069), this
-- adds account-time MTD/YTD day offsets to the windows CTE. DISTINCT handles days
-- where a calendar offset equals a fixed option. Source horizons, output contract,
-- atomic stage swap, UNKNOWN scope, and serverless/AI driver arm are unchanged.
--
-- Owner applies in Snowsight after V072. This file never runs from the app.
