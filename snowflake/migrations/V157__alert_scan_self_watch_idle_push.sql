-- V157__alert_scan_self_watch_idle_push.sql
--
-- Next-Fifty wave 2b, ranks 10a/b/d + 13 + 2 (ETL-cycle add-on arm) + 12c: the SINGLE wave-2 re-derivation
-- of both alert scans, each from its CURRENT definition V141 (tests/test_proc_lineage.py).
--
--   SP_ALERT_SCAN (hourly):
--     - arm [15] removed: it keyed on a rule whose ALERT_CONFIG row was deleted at V034, so it joined no
--       row, yet it was the hourly scan's only ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY read;
--     + [22] OPS_PIPELINE_DEGRADED (counting): pipeline self-watch -- a stale SOURCE_FRESHNESS_STATE row, a
--       loader failure that was logged and swallowed, or an idle alert notifier;
--     + [23] PIPE_ETL_CYCLE add-on (NOT counting): runs SP_SCAN_ETL_CYCLE (V156); a CONTROL_STATUS grant
--       gap logs etl_cycle_scan_failed and never trips OPS_SCAN_DEGRADED;
--     + condition-ended sweep (#12c): an OPEN SEC_CRED_EXPIRY / SEC_NEW_EXPOSURE event resolves as
--       CONDITION_ENDED once ACCOUNT_USAGE shows the credential rotated/removed or the PUBLIC grant batch
--       fully revoked (OPEN only, 1h dwell, positive evidence only);
--     ~ the V091 auto-clear sweep is scoped to its 3 PERF rules (the only rules whose still-firing set it
--       recomputes), so opting another rule into AUTO_CLEAR_ENABLED never blanket-clears it after 1h;
--     ~ arm [10]: a prior event closed before the current expiry's warning window opened (by anyone -- a
--       human ACTIONED/NOISE/EXPECTED resolve included) or machine-closed (CONDITION_ENDED / SUPERSEDED)
--       no longer blocks the credential's key, so a rotated credential's next expiry cycle re-alerts (the
--       key itself is unchanged; a live event or a close inside the current window still blocks), and
--       EXPIRING is never minted while that credential's EXPIRED event is live;
--     + [hb] heartbeat: stamps SOURCE_FRESHNESS_STATE 'ALERT_SCAN_HOURLY' last in every run.
--     Counting arms stay 13 (13 - [15] + [22]); the self-alert literal is unchanged.
--   SP_ALERT_SCAN_DAILY:
--     + [22] OPS_PIPELINE_DEGRADED (byte-identical to the hourly copy; shared dedupe keys, so whichever
--       graph is alive raises each finding once);
--     + [24] COST_IDLE_OPPORTUNITY (counting): weekly idle-waste push, the DB-side twin of the Optimize
--       ACTIONABLE figure (net of the 60s resume tail, settings-verified timer from the newest SHOW
--       WAREHOUSES snapshot batch -- a dropped/renamed warehouse never raises -- 14 complete Central days);
--     + [hb] heartbeat 'ALERT_SCAN_DAILY'. Counting arms 9 -> 11.
--   ALERT_CONFIG: OPS_PIPELINE_DEGRADED (PLATFORM, HIGH) and COST_IDLE_OPPORTUNITY (COST, MEDIUM, 100 USD/month,
--   HIGH band at 5x) are seeded WHEN NOT MATCHED only. SEC_CRED_EXPIRY and SEC_NEW_EXPOSURE are opted into
--   auto-clear AFTER both procs are replaced (never before: V141's unscoped sweep would blanket-clear them).
--
-- Everything else in both V141 bodies is byte-identical (tests/migrations/test_v157_* normalizes each back
-- to V141): DECLARE, [wake], the 12 surviving hourly arms, both self-alerts (hourly literal 13), the V067/V115
-- supersede sweep, the V091 body except its one scope line, the V117 carry-forward, the daily arms
-- [06]-[19], the [17]/[18] add-ons and the V064 trailing-30-complete-day burn.
--
-- FIRST RUN: every SOURCE_FRESHNESS_STATE row already past its cadence raises one HIGH OPS_PIPELINE_DEGRADED
-- event, and the first daily run raises this ISO week's COST_IDLE_OPPORTUNITY events (preview with the
-- separate read-only PREFLIGHT_WAVE2B.sql). A credential already inside its expiry window whose only prior
-- SEC_CRED_EXPIRY event for that key was closed before this expiry's window opened (an earlier cycle, e.g.
-- human-resolved) raises its previously suppressed event once (CRITICAL if already expired). A close inside
-- the current window still suppresses it. Deploy the app build that excludes CONDITION_ENDED from the
-- human-resolution metrics BEFORE applying (it shipped in wave 2a). No procedure runs at apply time: the scans
-- pick this up on their next scheduled run.
-- ROLLBACK (order matters): FIRST, by hand (never inside a migration), switch AUTO_CLEAR_ENABLED off for
-- SEC_CRED_EXPIRY and SEC_NEW_EXPOSURE; only THEN re-run V141's two procs (RUNBOOK section 12, "Rolling back
-- V157"). Reversed, an hourly scan landing between the two steps runs V141's unscoped V091 sweep, which
-- AUTO_CLEARs their OPEN events 1h after raise -- and V141's arms [10]/[20] never re-raise an auto-cleared key.
-- Apply AFTER V156 (SP_SCAN_ETL_CYCLE must exist for [23]; before it, the arm only logs
-- etl_cycle_scan_failed). Idempotent; safe to re-run.
