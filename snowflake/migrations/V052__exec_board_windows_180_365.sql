-- V052__exec_board_windows_180_365.sql — long-history window filter
-- (owner ask 2026-07-27: expand triage window to 180/365, mart-history only).
--
--   Adds 180 and 365 to the exec-board loader's window set so Overview's KPIs
--   have real board rows for the two new filter options (the loader windows
--   are locked to equal app.config.DAY_WINDOW_OPTIONS). Board inputs are
--   long-retention facts, so these are history, not a live rescan. Live
--   ACCOUNT_USAGE scans stay capped at 90 (MAX_LIVE_WINDOW_DAYS) — the app
--   surfaces which panels honor the long window.
--
--   Proc swap + one board reload; no new objects. Apply AFTER V051.
--   Idempotent; safe to re-run.
--
-- Derivation law: SP_REFRESH_EXEC_BOARD from V045 verbatim + one enumerated
-- edit (windows CTE gains 180/365); tests/test_v052_windows.py re-derives
-- and byte-compares.
