## 4.1.0 — feature waves V012–V020 + hardening pass (2026-07-07)

Everything shipped after the 4.0.0 rebuild, plus a 20-item review pass.

Feature waves (V012–V020, see FEATURES.md for the full map):
- Alert drawer with playbooks, AI explain, inline closed-loop fixes; webhook
  delivery in-chain with per-family routing; anomaly events pre-explained by
  grounded Cortex; morning AI digest.
- Saved views, default landing, per-user display timezone (USER_PREFS, V013).
- Change-impact regression tracker, fingerprint drift, incident correlation
  timeline, savings verifier (ESTIMATED → VERIFIED/REJECTED).
- Role-based Trexis user scoping via COMPANY_FOR_USER (V019);
  WH_TRXS_LINEAGE; CREDENTIALS expiry rule re-enabled on EXPIRATION_DATE (V020).
- Design system D: SVG nav, status bar, sparklines, section consolidation.

Hardening pass (2026-07-07):
- Row caps can no longer be disabled by a column/comment containing the word
  "limit" (word-boundary LIMIT detection in the query engine).
- Python-side "today" now uses the account timezone (America/Chicago) for MTD
  boundaries, forecasts, contract pace, and statement months — no more
  evening-hours day drift under SiS/UTC.
- Transient role-probe failures no longer pin the session to the ANALYST
  profile; the sidebar Refresh also re-resolves the role.
- Cortex COMPLETE now carries a 90s statement timeout; usage logging and the
  error sink write async (page switches and failure paths stop paying a
  blocking INSERT round trip).
- Exported executive-summary HTML escapes every field; sidebar strip escapes
  interpolated text; expired-session errors get a friendly "press Refresh"
  message; page-boundary captions name Python bug types explicitly.
- Altair theme registered via the altair ≥5.5 API (deprecation warning gone,
  altair-6-proof); ruff rule set widened (C4/SIM/PIE/PERF/RUF); CI gets
  concurrency-cancel, pip caching, and a 15-minute timeout; connection
  failures show the underlying reason on the not-connected screen.

## 4.0.0 — ground-up rebuild (2026-07-07)

Full rewrite in a new repo, driven by the 2026-07-07 hostile panel review of
the original OVERWATCH.

- 7 pages (Overview, Control Room, Alerts, Cost & Contract, Operations,
  Security, Admin) replacing 6 shells + ~30 zombie section modules.
- Pure, tested logic layer (formulas, anomaly, forecast, scoring, actions).
- Single SQL-safety module; blind-except ban enforced by ruff in CI.
- Query engine that never caches errors, shows truncation, keys cache by role.
- Mart-first data architecture with versioned migrations (V001–V005),
  dedicated XSMALL warehouse + resource monitor, chained hourly/daily tasks.
- Billed spend now applies `CREDITS_ADJUSTMENT_CLOUD_SERVICES`.
- Rates ($3.68 compute / $2.20 Cortex) moved to `SETTINGS`; admin-gated.
- No synthetic data anywhere: real series or honest empty states.
- ALFA/Trexis hardcoded scoping isolated to `app/companies.py` with
  `KEBARR1 → ALFA` override; code/seed sync covered by a unit test.
