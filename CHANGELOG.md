## 4.0.0 — ground-up rebuild (2026-07-07)

Full rewrite in a new repo, driven by the 2026-07-07 hostile panel review of
the original OVERWATCH.

- 7 pages (Overview, Control Room, Alerts, Cost & Contract, Operations,
  Security, Admin) replacing 6 shells + ~30 zombie section modules.
- Pure, tested logic layer (formulas, anomaly, forecast, scoring, actions).
- Single SQL-safety module; blind-except ban enforced by ruff in CI.
- Query engine that never caches errors, shows truncation, keys cache by role.
- Mart-first data architecture with versioned migrations (V001–V005),
  dedicated XSMALL warehouse + resource monitor, chained hourly/daily tasks.
- Billed spend now applies `CREDITS_ADJUSTMENT_CLOUD_SERVICES`.
- Rates ($3.68 compute / $2.20 Cortex) moved to `CORE.SETTINGS`; admin-gated.
- No synthetic data anywhere: real series or honest empty states.
- ALFA/Trexis hardcoded scoping isolated to `app/companies.py` with
  `KEBARR1 → ALFA` override; code/seed sync covered by a unit test.
